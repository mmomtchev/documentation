# Fork Notes

This fork restores the C++ support for `documentation.js`.

It is currently slightly above the level of the old `--polyglot` CLI option of `documentation.js` that got axed in 2017.

The project should already be usable.

I intend to add extensible helpers allowing to extract some (*C++ is notoriously difficult to parse and this aims to be an universal extractor anyways*) information from the C++ code.

Its future is still under discussions, it might:
* get merged into the trunk
* be transformed into a plugin
* be published as-is
